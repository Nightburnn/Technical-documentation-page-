      <p>Marijuana or cannabis is a soft drug that has been used by humans for thousand of years.
      It is endemic to south and central Asia and evidence of its use by Arons,Assyrians, and Hindus of Asia are plenty </p>
      <p>Marijuana is produced from a plant called Cannabis Sativa or cannabis Indica. This plant also goes by the name Indian hemp. Marijuana is the name given to those parts of this plant which is smoked.The most important chemical agent in marijuana is a compound called tetrahydrocannabinol. However, marijuana smoke contains over 400 different chemicals including 66 other related cannabinoids.The debate on the use of medical marijuana in the United States and some other parts of the world has long been ended. In fact, marijuana now can be bought legally within 23 states of the US and other public stores in other parts of the world. It goes to show that the medicinal value that is attached to the use of marijuana far outweighs any negative effects that come along with its uses. Fact about marijuana:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Marijuana is now widely known for its medicinal values. Controversially, however, the therapeutic benefits of marijuana cannot be ignored by simply blaming the drug for causing addiction or a dependency for its users.</li>
        <li>The UN estimates that around 4% of world population use cannabis annually. In short, it is the number one used illegal drug in the world</li>
        <li>Marijuana is not only very useful in treating many illnesses and diseases, but it also has become a drug which is extraordinarily safe — safer than most medicines prescribed every day.</li>

Humans have turned to it as an herbal remedy for centuries, and today people use it to relieve symptoms or treat various diseases. The federal government still considers it illegal, but some states allow it to treat specific health problems. The FDA, the U.S. agency that regulates medicines, hasn’t approved the plant as a treatment for any conditions.</li>
         <li><img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/medical_marijuana_overview_slideshow/1800ss_medical_images_rf_thc_chemical_formula.jpg?resize=650px:*" alt=" " width="300" height="250"> Marijuana has chemicals called cannabinoids. Medical researchers usually focus on the health effects of two in particular: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the substance that makes you high; CBD doesn’t have mind-altering effects.</li>
        <li><img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/medical_marijuana_overview_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_forms_of_medical_marijuana.jpg?resize=650px:*" alt=" " width="300" height="250"> There are a variety of ways to take the drug. You can inhale a vaporized spray, smoke the leaves, take a pill or liquid, or bake it into foods. All of the types differ in terms of how often you should use them, how they’ll affect your symptoms, and side effects you may feel.</li>
         <li><img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/medical_marijuana_overview_slideshow/1800ss_science_source_rm_cannabinoid_receptors_in_brain.jpg?resize=650px:*" alt=" " width="300" height="250"> The chemicals in marijuana affect you when they connect with specific parts of cells called receptors. Scientists know that you have cells with cannabinoid receptors in your brain and in your immune system. But the exact process of how the drug affects them isn’t clear yet.</li>

      <p>A new study underscores the need for additional research on the effect of medical marijuana laws on opioid overdose deaths and cautions against drawing a causal connection between the two</p>
      <p>Early research suggested that there may be a relationship between the availability of medical marijuana and opioid analgesic overdose mortality. In particular, a NIDA-funded study published in 2014 found that from 1999 to 2010, states with medical cannabis laws experienced slower rates of increase in opioid analgesic overdose death rates compared to states without such laws.</p>
      <p>A 2019 analysis, also funded by NIDA, re-examined this relationship using data through 2017. Similar to the findings reported previously, this research team found that opioid overdose mortality rates between 1999-2010 in states allowing medical marijuana use were 21% lower than expected. When the analysis was extended through 2017, however, they found that the trend reversed, such that states with medical cannabis laws experienced an overdose death rate 22.7% higher than expected.</p>

      <p><strong> pain management</strong>
The cannabinoids in marijuana may reduce pain by altering pain perception pathways in the brain. This may be helpful to treat conditions that cause chronic pain, such as:

arthritis
fibromyalgia
endometriosis
migraine
<br>
<strong> Neurological and mental disorders</strong>
Due to its effects on the limbic system, doctors sometimes prescribe marijuana to treat the following neurological and mental health conditions:
<ul>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>epilepsy</li>
<li>multiple sclerosis</li>
<li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
<li>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
<li>Tourette syndrome</li>
<li>Sleep management</li>
</ul>
The relaxing effects of marijuana may help improve sleep disorders, such as insomnia. And improved sleep may also occur when pain is reduced from marijuana usage.</p>

    <article>
      <p>According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), possible side effects of cannabis use include:
<ul>
<li>increased heart rate</li>
<li>low blood pressure</li>
<li>dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting</li>
<li>short-term reduced memory</li>
<li>short-term reduced attention span</li>
<li>decreased problem-solving skills</li>

It’s important to know that these side effects are dose dependent and are more likely to occur with larger doses and with inexperienced cannabis users.

People with mental or emotional disorders may experience paranoia or hallucinations. It could also make their depression or mania worse.</p>
